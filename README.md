# SeleniumExample
A very simple Selenium WebDriver C# code Example

# Updates to the example project
Updates to the project will be forth coming shortly. I will be removing the "STATIC" class and page model objects for my dynamic and memory friendly versions. I will also be updating the nuget packages that interface with the selenium driver to a diffrent source.
